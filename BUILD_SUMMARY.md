# CDK Swift Build Summary

## What Was Accomplished

✅ **Successfully created a Swift library structure** based on the bdk-swift pattern
✅ **Built the cdk-ffi Rust crate** successfully with uniffi bindings  
✅ **Generated Swift bindings** from the CDK FFI using uniffi-bindgen
✅ **Created XCFramework** with the compiled Rust static library
✅ **Created build scripts** for native and cross-platform compilation

## Generated Files

- **Package.swift**: Swift Package Manager configuration
- **build-xcframework.sh**: Full cross-platform build script (iOS, macOS)
- **build-native.sh**: Simplified native-only build script for testing
- **cdkFFI.xcframework**: Generated XCFramework containing the Rust library
- **Sources/CashuDevKit/Generated/**: Directory containing uniffi-generated Swift bindings
  - `CashuDevKit.swift`: Main Swift API bindings (5000+ lines)
  - `CashuDevKitFFI.h`: C header with function declarations
  - `CashuDevKitFFI.modulemap`: Module map for Swift integration

## Current Status

The core infrastructure is working:
- ✅ Rust library compiles successfully
- ✅ UniFFI generates Swift bindings correctly  
- ✅ XCFramework is created with proper structure
- ✅ Headers and module maps are generated

**Integration Challenge**: There are linking issues with Swift Package Manager finding the C symbols from the static library. This is a common challenge when integrating Rust libraries with Swift and requires fine-tuning the module configuration.

## Generated API Surface

The Swift bindings include comprehensive CDK functionality:
- `Wallet` class with methods for mint/melt operations
- `WalletBuilder` for wallet configuration
- `Amount`, `CurrencyUnit`, `MintUrl` types
- `SendOptions`, `ReceiveOptions` for transaction configuration
- `SecretKey` generation and management
- `generateSeed()` function
- Error handling with `FfiError` types

## Environment Configuration

The project uses the `CDK_DIR` environment variable to locate the CDK repository:

```bash
# Default: expects CDK at ../cdk
just build-native

# Custom location
export CDK_DIR=/path/to/cdk
just build-native

# Or per-command override
CDK_DIR=/path/to/cdk just build-native
```

See [CDK_ENVIRONMENT.md](CDK_ENVIRONMENT.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

## Build Commands

### Using Justfile (Recommended)
```bash
# List all available commands
just list

# Build for native platform (fastest for development)
just build-native

# Build for all platforms (iOS, macOS)
just build

# Generate Swift bindings only
just generate-bindings

# Build Rust library only
just build-rust

# Clean all builds
just clean

# Run validation tests
just test-xcframework
just test-bindings
just test-rust

# Check system requirements
just check-tools

# Show project info
just info
```

### Using Shell Scripts Directly
```bash
# Generate bindings and build library
./build-native.sh

# For full cross-platform build (requires additional iOS targets)
./build-xcframework.sh
```

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Resolve Swift Package Manager linking**: The C symbols need to be properly linked
2. **Test API functionality**: Once linking works, test the generated Swift API
3. **Add iOS targets**: Install additional Rust targets for full iOS support
4. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive Swift documentation and examples

The foundation is solid and the hard work of FFI binding generation is complete. The remaining work is primarily Swift packaging configuration.
